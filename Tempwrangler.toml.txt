 Ah — now I see exactly what’s happening. The warning in Cloudflare Pages is because your wrangler.toml is being interpreted as a Pages configuration, but it’s actually a Workers Functions + Pages hybrid setup. Pages expects either:

pages_build_output_dir for static-only sites

Or functions + publish folder for a Worker-backed Pages site

Currently, your file mixes things in a way that Pages is warning about:

[build]
command = "npm run build"
publish = "dist"
pages_build_output_dir = "dist"


Here’s why the warning occurs:

pages_build_output_dir is only for static Pages sites.

You also have functions in your repo (/functions) which is for Workers Functions.

Cloudflare sees both, gets confused, and warns that the wrangler.toml “does not appear to be valid.”

How to fix:

Since you’re using Workers Functions + SPA static assets, the correct wrangler.toml should look like this:

name = "vite-react-worker"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-07"

[build]
command = "npm run build"
# Publish is for Pages to serve static assets (dist folder)
publish = "dist"

# Specify functions directory for Worker backend
[functions]
directory = "functions"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "ittyvite"
database_id = "d94879ca-7319-421f-82c4-1e13cad5e649"


Key points:

Remove pages_build_output_dir — that’s only for pure Pages (no Functions).

Add [functions] directory = "functions" so Pages knows where your Worker code is.

Keep publish = "dist" to serve your SPA static assets.

With this configuration:

/functions/index.js will act as the Worker backend for your API + SPA fallback.

dist/ will be served automatically for static assets like JS, CSS, images.

Cloudflare Pages won’t throw the “wrangler.toml does not appear valid” warning anymore.
